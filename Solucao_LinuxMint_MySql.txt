--->>>> MySql workbench : Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' in linux


The reason is that recent Ubuntu installation (maybe others also), 
mysql is using by default the UNIX or  auth_socket plugin.


1. set root user to mysql_native_password

$ sudo mysql -u root -p # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql:~ USE mysql;
SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;
mysql:~ UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql:~ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql:~ exit;

$ service mysql restart




2. Add new db_user with you system_user(recommended)
$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql:~ USE mysql;
mysql:~ CREATE USER 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';
mysql:~ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost';
mysql:~ UPDATE user SET plugin='auth_socket' WHERE User='YOUR_SYSTEM_USER';
mysql:~ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql:~ exit;

$ service mysql restart

Remember that if you use option #2 you'll have to connect to mysql as your system username (mysql -u YOUR_SYSTEM_USER)
